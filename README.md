## Overview 

Being international students we are aware of the problem faced by the students while shortlisting and finalizing the University and hence in this project we’ll be creating a set of databases which will have a list of at least 100 universities along with the prerequisites of each course. 

The main focus of the project is to evaluate a student's profile and thereby shortlist the universities on the basis of their portfolio. We will be retrieving the data by scrapping various websites and combining the cleaned data to create a proper database for the accurate prediction of acceptance and recommendation of the Universities.

To fetch the data we’ll be scraping the data from US news, YMgrad and Yocket. After cleaning the fetched  data the variables that will be used are - University Name, City/State, Ranking, Programs, Fees, Prerequisites, Acceptance Rate, Application fee waiver etc. Thereafter predicting the chances of acceptance and recommending universities  by using database queries and  regression techniques.

The Key feature of the project is that instead of referring to multiple websites which only have data of their subscribed students, one can find a perfect solution on this database. Since we are merging various databases, the recommendations will be accurate.
